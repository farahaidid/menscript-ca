            Are online consultations any good?
          </h1>

          <p class="blog-text">
            Today, many face-to-face consultations involve the GP asking the
            patient the same set of routine quesitons during each visit. These
            questions are asked because of safety reasons, but the repetition is
            unnecessary. This type of consultation can easily be replaced and on
            menscript.com we do this by an online asynchronous method - where
            the patient fills out a structured online questionairre that will be
            reviewed by a doctor at a later time. This method saves the patient
            a visit to the doctor office and also significantly reduced the need
            for a face-to-face consultation. An evident downside of asynchronous
            consultations is that the doctor cannot examine the patient. It is
            for this reason that we also offer synchronous consultations - where
            a face-to-face consultation is held using video technology software
            using Skype.
